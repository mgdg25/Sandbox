One morning, a woman decided to go on a walk.
She took her top hat, an umbrealla and her favourite newspaper.
The first thing on her way to the club was of course paying a visit
to her old friend Barry, called Barry the Butcher by his friends.
Well, he was called so for literally being a butcher.
After spending some time talking to her best friend, a woman
continued his walk to the club.
While she was enjoing his walk, suddenly a rain started.
It wasn't a usual London long and nasty rain; it was a violent thunderstorm
all over the East side
She went home after visiting a shop and went to sleep.
Although she was an old insomniac, she fell asleep very fast;
soon, her snore could be heard two blocks away.
She slept for four hours, then she woke up, and then she slept for four more hours.

And they lived happily ever after.
