One morning, a man decided to go on a walk.
He took his top hat, an umbrealla and his favourite newspaper.
The first thing on his way to the club was of course paying a visit
to his old friend Barry, called Barry the Butcher by his friends.
Well, he was called so for literally being a butcher.
After spending some time talking to his best friend, a man
continued his walk to the club.
While he was enjoing his walk, suddenly a rain started.
It wasn't a usual London long and nasty rain; it was a violent thunderstorm
all over the East side.
He went home after visiting a shop and went to sleep.
Although he was an old insomniac, he fell asleep very fast;
soon, his snore could be heard two blocks away.
He slept for four hours, then he woke up, and then he slept for four more hours.
