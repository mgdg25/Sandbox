One morning, a man decided to go on a walk.
He took his top hat, an umbrealla and his favourite newspaper.
The first thing on his way to the club was of course paying a visit
to his old friend Barry, called Barry the Butcher by his friends.
Well, he was called so for literally being a butcher.
After spending some time talking to his best friend, a man
continued his walk to the club.
He went home after visiting a shop and went to sleep.
