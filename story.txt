One morning, a woman decided to go on a walk.
She took her top hat, an umbrealla and her favourite newspaper.
The first thing on her way to the club was of course paying a visit
to her old friend Barry, called Barry the Butcher by his friends.
Well, he was called so for literally being a butcher.
After spending some time talking to her best friend, a woman
continued his walk to the club.
She went home after visiting a shop and went to sleep.
Although she was an old insomniac, she fell asleep very fast;
soon, her snore could be heard two blocks away.
She slept for four hours, then she woke up, and then she slept for four more hours.
